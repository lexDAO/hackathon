## Cook-out for WY DAO bill

The difference between a butcher and surgeon is **knowing where to cut**

### Why?

LexDAO is a [guild](https://lexdao.substack.com/p/legal-engineering-certification-via-nft) of legal engineers with mission to innovate and bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code. Wyoming is pioneering [DAO friendly](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/22/state-lawmaker-explains-wyomings-newly-passed-dao-llc-law/) legislation and is requesting [public comments](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Calendar/20220101/Meeting?type=committee&id=13118) on [DAO]( https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2022012422LSO-0063v0.6.pdf), [identity](https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2022012422LSO-0203v0.6.pdf), and [privacy](https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2022012422LSO-0146v0.7.pdf). We intend to assemble a banquet of **codeslaw chefs** to cook up buffalo burger (WY Title 17-31) using functional ([regulatory](https://coala.global/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf)) equivalence.

### How2

1. Convene a hackathon to crowdsource, compile and compose a formal submission based on public policy, market accepted practices (LexDAO prior consults) and specific preferred legislative wording;
2. Nominate a LexDAO representive to address any questions at the Committee face [vid-meeting](https://wyoleg-gov.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ZZ-Tk063RTCbH38Z22SHJw);
3. Document specific clauses for LLC operating agreements and the matching smart contract into a private wiki.

### For3 (How much)
As external raid, request sufficient LDM tokens for apprentices to earn membership and **enough gas to mint the PoAPs**. *Optionally* an advance (future grant application of $2k for gitcoin) for bounty for an OpenLaw markdown -> XHTML -> PDF toolchain. The members that **successfully contribute to the wiki** will be considered for [LEETH certification](https://medium.com/@NickJRishwain/legal-engineering-certification-via-nft-by-lexdao-891350abdc2d).

Tentative Budget [TBC Weds governance call]

- 3 signed copies of Lawrence Lessig book (3 x $20)
- Enought gas to mint PoAPs (~10 chef, ~10 taster, 3 mentors)

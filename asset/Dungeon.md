# Dungeon Crawl

In the classic [MIT style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) with reference to [Berlin Interpretation](https://blog.roguetemple.com/roguelike-definition/roguelikeness-factors/) but oriented towards edu-t®️ainment (gamification), ie giving coders an accelerated [experiental learning]() of applied law subset as applied to cryptosystems. Rogue-like refers to a genre, comprising
- random generation ... due to the connection to IRL events, there has to be constraints on the fantasy elements, whilst there may be generative AI to add color, there must be consistent mise en scene to build up the interface objects;
- permadeath - no permadeath, perhaps a lost of time as penalty but due to tight time constraints, cannot restart
- turn-based is enforced by a linear thread within discord but since there are 3 Acts, can oeprate in parallel
- non-modal reflects IRL in that you can have multiple paths to the same goal, in this case 3 choices depending on knowledge of law
- complexity - at the moment this is manual but aim to progressively automate via hats protocol
- resource management - is key since there is fixed time (54 hours) and you expect contention with other hackathon participants;
- hack&slash - focus on the direct PITA from the land of shaDOW and their minions - in thie case USPTO has smoke & mirrors as weapons
- exploration - the mentors have access to cheat sheets so can drop hints or accelerate progress depending on progress
- single player - one discordID one natural person (as determined by POAP distribution)
- monsters == player - visitors can be treated as smoky distractions
- tactical challenges - should result in contention between participants which is resolvable via smart contracts (and game theory)
- ASCII - graphics are only to enhance the atmosphere
- level/rooms - in this case, 3 piece stage reflects the 3 days as permit guests to view afterwards
- attribute - based on the wallet which is typically a token bound account

# USPTO

The USPTO could be considered to be a procedural driven labyrith in that the TMEP comprises the rules. and you survive by reaching your bjective or changing the rules (akin to agora).

company in writing and return the report to it for correction.

operating agreement establishes or provides for the
establishment of a particular series:

(i) The debts, obligations or other liabilities of
the particular series, whether arising in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be enforceable against the assets of the series
only and not against:

(A) The assets of the limited liability company
generally or any other series thereof;

(B) Any member of the limited liability company.

(ii) The debts, obligations or other liabilities of
the limited liability company generally or any other series
thereof, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall
not be enforceable against the assets of the particular series.

(c) The limitations on liabilities in subsection (b) of
this section shall only apply if:

(i) The records for the particular series that
account for the assets of the series are separately maintained
from the records that account for the assets of the limited
liability company or any other series thereof. Records that
reasonably identify the assets of a particular series, including
by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational or
allocational formula or procedure such as a percentage or share
of assets or by any other method where the identity of the
assets is objectively determinable, shall be deemed to account
for the assets of the particular series separately from the
assets of the limited liability company or any other series
thereof;

(ii) The operating agreement specifically provides
for the limitations on liabilities; and

(iii) Notice of the limitations on liabilities of the
particular series is included in the articles of organization.
Notice under this paragraph shall be sufficient whether or not
the limited liability company has established or referenced any
particular series in the notice.

(d) Nothing in this section, an operating agreement or
articles of organization shall restrict:

(i) A series or limited liability company on behalf
of a series from agreeing in the operating agreement or
otherwise that any or all of the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of the limited liability company generally or any
other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of
the series;

(ii) A limited liability company from agreeing in the
operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts,
obligations or other liabilities of a series shall be
enforceable against the assets of the limited liability company
generally; or

(iii) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-304(a), a member or
manager from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise to
be personally liable for any or all of the debts, obligations or
other liabilities of a series.

(e) A series established under this section shall have the
power and capacity to, in its own name, contract, hold title to
assets including real, personal and intangible property, grant
liens and security interests and sue and be sued. A series may:

(i) Have separate rights, powers or duties with
respect to specified property or obligations of the limited
liability company or profits and losses associated with
specified property or obligations;

(ii) Carry on any lawful purpose regardless of
whether for profit, except for the purpose of acting as a
financial institution or acting as an insurer as defined in W.S.
26-1-102(a)(xvi);

(iii) Hold assets directly or indirectly, including
in the name of the series or the name of the limited liability
company.

(f) An operating agreement that establishes or provides
for the establishment of a series may:

(i) Provide for classes or groups of members or
managers of the series having the relative rights, powers and
duties specified in the operating agreement;

(ii) Provide for and specify the future creation of
additional classes or groups of members or managers of the
series having the relative rights, powers and duties as may be
established, including rights, powers and duties senior to
existing classes and groups of members or managers of the
series;

(iii) Provide for the taking of an action, including

approval of any member or manager or class or group of members
or managers of the series;

(iv) Provide that any member or class or group of
members of a series shall have no voting rights;

(v) Grant to all or certain identified members or
managers or class or group of members or managers of the series

class or group of members or managers of the series. Voting by

interest, class, group or other basis.

(g) The management of a series shall be vested as follows:

(i) In the members of the series pursuant to W.S.
17-29-407(b). A member shall cease to be a member of a series
upon the divestment of all of the member's transferable
interests of the series. The fact that a person ceases to be a
member of a particular series shall not by itself cause the
person to cease to be a member of the limited liability company
or any other series thereof or cause the termination of the
series, regardless of whether the person was the last remaining
member of the series; or

(ii) If the operating agreement provides for the
management of the series in whole or in part by a manager, the
management shall be vested in one (1) or more managers who shall
be chosen as provided in the operating agreement and who shall
hold the offices and have the responsibilities as specified in
the agreement. A manager shall cease to be a manager of a
series as provided in an operating agreement and subject to W.S.
17-29-407(c)(v). The fact that a person ceases to be a manager
of a particular series shall not by itself cause the person to
cease to be a manager of the limited liability company or any
other series thereof.

(h) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-404 and subject to
subsections (j) and (m) of this section, if a member of a series
becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the
status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a
creditor of the series with respect to the distribution. An
operating agreement may provide for the establishment of a
record date for allocations and distributions associated with a
series.

(j) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-405(a), a limited liability
company may make a distribution with respect to a series that
has been established under this section unless the total assets
of the series after the distribution would be less than the sum
of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed,
if the series were to be dissolved, wound up and terminated at
the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights
upon winding up and termination of members whose preferential
rights are superior to those of the persons receiving the
distribution. A member that receives a distribution knowing
that the distribution was made in violation of this subsection
is personally liable to the series for the amount of the
distribution. This subsection shall not affect any obligation
or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
law for the amount of a distribution, except that any action
under this subsection shall be subject to W.S. 17-29-406(e).
For purposes of this subsection, "distribution" does not include
amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past
services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of
business under a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits
program.

(k) Subject to W.S. 17-29-702, a series established under
this section may be terminated and its affairs wound up without
causing the dissolution of the limited liability company. The
termination of the series shall not affect the limitations on
liabilities of the series as provided in subsection (b) of this
section. A series is terminated and its affairs shall be wound
up upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) The dissolution of the limited liability company
under W.S. 17-29-702;

(ii) The time or happening of events specified in the
operating agreement;

(iii) The vote or consent of members of the series
who own more than two-thirds (2/3) of the interests in the
profits of the series; or

(iv) On application by a member or manager of the
series, the entry of a court order terminating the series on the
grounds that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the
purposes of the series in conformity with the operating
agreement.

(m) A person winding up the affairs of a series may, in
the name of the limited liability company and for and on behalf
of the limited liability company and the series, take all
actions with respect to the series as authorized by W.S.
17-29-702. The person shall provide for the claims and
obligations of the series and distribute the assets of the
series as provided in W.S. 17-29-708. Actions taken in
accordance with this subsection shall not affect the liability
of members and shall not impose liability on a liquidating
trustee appointed in accordance with this subsection.
Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-702, the following persons may wind
up the affairs of a series:

(i) A manager of the series who has not wrongfully
terminated the series;

(ii) If the series has no manager who qualifies under
paragraph (i) of this subsection, the members of the series or a
person approved by the members;

(iii) The members who own more than fifty (50%)
percent of the interests in the profits of the series;

(iv) On application of a member or manager of the
series or any personal representative or assignee of the member
or manager, and upon cause shown, a court or a liquidating
trustee appointed by the court.

(n) A foreign limited liability company doing business in
this state and governed by an operating agreement that
establishes or provides for the establishment of one (1) or more
designated series of members, managers, transferable interests
or assets shall state the following on its certificate of
authority:

(i) That the operating agreement of the foreign
limited liability company establishes or provides for the
establishment of series having separate rights, powers or duties
with respect to specified property or obligations of the foreign
limited liability company or profits and losses associated with
specified property or obligations;

(ii) If any of the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of any particular series, whether arising in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be enforceable against the
assets of the particular series only and not against the assets
of the foreign limited liability company generally or any other
series thereof;

(iii) If any of the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of the foreign limited liability company generally
or any other series thereof, whether arising in contract, tort
or otherwise, shall be enforceable against the assets of the
particular series.

(o) The secretary of state shall charge and collect fees
from limited liability companies and foreign limited liability
companies establishing one (1) or more series in the amount of
ten dollars ($10.00) per series designated or established under
this section.

## ARTICLE 3 - RELATIONS OF MEMBERS AND MANAGERS TO PERSONS DEALING WITH LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY

### **17-29-301. No agency power of member as member.**

(a) A member is not an agent of a limited liability
company solely by reason of being a member.

(b) A person's status as a member does not prevent or
restrict law other than this chapter from imposing liability on
a limited liability company because of the person's conduct.

### **17-29-302. Statement of authority.**

(a) A limited liability company may deliver to the
secretary of state for filing a statement of authority. The
statement:

with respect to the company, may state the authority, or
limitations on the authority, of all persons holding the

liability company shall deliver to the secretary of state for
filing an amendment or cancellation stating:

(i) The name of the company;

(ii) The street and mailing addresses of the
company's designated office;

(iii) The caption of the statement being amended or
cancelled and the date the statement being affected became
effective; and

(iv) The contents of the amendment or a declaration
that the statement being affected is cancelled.

(c) A statement of authority affects only the power of a
person to bind a limited liability company to persons that are
not members.

(d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section and W.S.
17-29-103(d) and except as otherwise provided in subsections

(f), (g) and (h) of this section, a limitation on the authority
of a person or a position contained in an effective statement of
authority is not by itself evidence of knowledge or notice of
the limitation by any person.

(e) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a grant of
authority not pertaining to transfers of real property and
contained in an effective statement of authority is conclusive
in favor of a person that gives value in reliance on the grant,
except to the extent that when the person gives value:

(i) The person has knowledge to the contrary;

(ii) The statement has been cancelled or
restrictively amended under subsection (b) of this section; or

(iii) A limitation on the grant is contained in
another statement of authority that became effective after the
statement containing the grant became effective.

(f) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, an
effective statement of authority that grants authority to
transfer real property held in the name of the limited liability
company and that is recorded by certified copy in the office for
recording transfers of the real property is conclusive in favor
of a person that gives value in reliance on the grant without
knowledge to the contrary, except to the extent that when the
person gives value:

(i) The statement has been cancelled or restrictively
amended under subsection (b) of this section and a certified
copy of the cancellation or restrictive amendment has been
recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real
property; or

(ii) A limitation on the grant is contained in
another statement of authority that became effective after the
statement containing the grant became effective and a certified
copy of the later effective statement is recorded in the office
for recording transfers of the real property.

(g) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a
certified copy of an effective statement containing a limitation
on the authority to transfer real property held in the name of a
limited liability company is recorded in the office for
recording transfers of that real property, all persons are
deemed to know of the limitation.

(h) Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an
effective statement of dissolution or termination is a
cancellation of any filed statement of authority for the
purposes of subsection (f) of this section and is a limitation
on authority for the purposes of subsection (g) of this section.

(j) After a statement of dissolution becomes effective, a
limited liability company may deliver to the secretary of state
for filing and, if appropriate, may record a statement of
authority that is designated as a post dissolution statement of
authority. The statement operates as provided in subsections

(f) and (g) of this section.

(k) Unless earlier cancelled, an effective statement of
authority is cancelled by operation of law five (5) years after
the date on which the statement, or its most recent amendment,
becomes effective. This cancellation operates without need for
any recording under subsection (f) or (g) of this section.

(m) An effective statement of denial operates as a
restrictive amendment under this section and may be recorded by
certified copy for the purposes of paragraph (f)(i) of this
section.

### **17-29-304. Liability of members and managers.**

(a) The debts, obligations or other liabilities of a
limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort or
otherwise:

(i) Are solely the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of the company; and

(ii) Do not become the debts, obligations or other
liabilities of a member or manager solely by reason of the
member acting as a member or manager acting as a manager.

(b) Repealed by Laws 2016, ch. 54, √Ç¬ß 2.

(c) For purposes of imposing liability on any member or
manager of a limited liability company for the debts,
obligations or other liabilities of the company, a court shall
consider only the following factors no one (1) of which, except
fraud, is sufficient to impose liability:

(i) Fraud;

(ii) Inadequate capitalization;

(iii) Failure to observe company formalities as
required by law; and

(iv) Intermingling of assets, business operations and
finances of the company and the members to such an extent that
there is no distinction between them.

(d) In any analysis conducted under subsection (c) of this
section, a court shall not consider factors intrinsic to the
character and operation of a limited liability company, whether
a single or multiple member limited liability company. Factors
intrinsic to the character and operation of a limited liability
company include but are not limited to:

(i) The ability to elect treatment as a disregarded
or pass-through entity for tax purposes;

personal assets from the obligations and acts of the limited
liability company.

## ARTICLE 4 - RELATIONS OF MEMBERS TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY

### **17-29-401. Becoming a member.**

(a) If a limited liability company is to have only one (1)
member upon formation, the person becomes a member as determined
by that person and the organizer of the company. That person
and the organizer may be, but need not be, different persons.
If different, the organizer acts on behalf of the initial
member.

(b) If a limited liability company is to have more than
one (1) member upon formation, those persons become members as
agreed by them. The organizer acts on behalf of the persons in
forming the company and may be, but need not be, one of the
persons.

(c) Reserved.

(d) After formation of a limited liability company, a
person becomes a member:

(i) As provided in the operating agreement;

(ii) As the result of a transaction effective under
article 10 of this chapter;

(iii) With the consent of all the members; or

(vi) If, within ninety (90) consecutive days after
the company ceases to have any members:

(A) The last person to have been a member, or
the legal representative of that person, designates a person to
become a member; and

(B) The designated person consents to become a
member.

(e) A person may become a member without acquiring a
transferable interest and without making or being obligated to
make a contribution to the limited liability company.

### **17-29-402. Form of contribution.**
A contribution may consist of tangible or intangible property or
other benefit to a limited liability company, including money,
services performed, promissory notes, other agreements to
contribute money or property and contracts for services to be
performed.

### **17-29-403. Liability for contributions.**
A person's obligation to make a contribution to a limited
liability company is not excused by the person's death,
disability or other inability to perform personally. If a
person does not make a required contribution, the person or the
person's estate is obligated to contribute money equal to the
value of the part of the contribution which has not been made,
at the option of the company.

### **17-29-404. Sharing of and right to distributions before dissolution.**

(a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company
before its dissolution and winding up shall be in equal shares
among members and dissociated members, except:

(i) To the extent otherwise provided in a written or
verbal operating agreement as set forth in W.S. 17-29-110;

(ii) To the extent necessary to comply with any
transfer effective under W.S. 17-29-502 and any charging order
in effect under W.S. 17-29-503; or

(iii) To the extent otherwise represented by the
company through an authorized representative in tax filings with
the Internal Revenue Service in which the status elected by the
company is not timely disputed by any member.

(b) A person has a right to a distribution before the
dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company only
if the company decides to make an interim distribution. A
person's dissociation does not entitle the person to a
distribution.

(c) A person does not have a right to demand or receive a
distribution from a limited liability company in any form other
than money. Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 17-29-708(c),
a limited liability company may distribute an asset in kind if
each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each
person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the
person's share of distributions.

(d) If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive
a distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and
is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the
limited liability company with respect to the distribution.

### **17-29-405. Limitations on distribution.**

(a) A limited liability company shall not make a
distribution if after the distribution:

(i) The company would not be able to pay its debts as
they become due in the ordinary course of the company's
activities; or

(ii) The company's total assets would be less than
the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be
needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up and
terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the
preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up and termination
of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of
persons receiving the distribution.

(b) A limited liability company may base a determination
that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) of
this section on financial statements prepared on the basis of
accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the
circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is
reasonable under the circumstances.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this
section, the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) of
this section is measured:

(i) In the case of a distribution by purchase,
redemption or other acquisition of a transferable interest in
the company, as of the date money or other property is
transferred or debt incurred by the company; and

(ii) In all other cases, as of the date:

(A) The distribution is authorized, if the
payment occurs within one hundred twenty (120) days after that
date; or

(B) The payment is made, if the payment occurs
more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the distribution
is authorized.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing, a
limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by
reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is
at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general,
unsecured creditors.

(e) A limited liability company's indebtedness, including
indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a
distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (a)
of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that
payment of principal and interest are made only to the extent
that a distribution could be made to members under this section.

(f) If indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each
payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated
as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date
the payment is made.

(g) In subsection (a) of this section, "distribution" does
not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for
present or past services or reasonable payments made in the
ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or
other benefits program.

### **17-29-406. Liability for improper distributions.**

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this
section, if a member of a member-managed limited liability
company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability
company consents to a distribution made in violation of W.S.
17-29-405 and in consenting to the distribution fails to comply
with W.S. 17-29-409, the member or manager is personally liable
to the company for the amount of the distribution that exceeds
the amount that could have been distributed without the
violation of W.S. 17-29-405.

(b) To the extent the operating agreement of a member-
managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of
the authority and responsibility to consent to distributions and
imposes that authority and responsibility on one (1) or more
other members, the liability stated in subsection (a) of this
section applies to the other members and not the member that the
operating agreement relieves of authority and responsibility.

(c) A person that receives a distribution knowing that the
distribution to that person was made in violation of W.S.
17-29-405 is personally liable to the limited liability company
but only to the extent that the distribution received by the
person exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid
under W.S. 17-29-405.

(d) A person against which an action is commenced because
the person is liable under subsection (a) of this section may:

(i) Implead any other person that is subject to
liability under subsection (a) of this section and seek to
compel contribution from the person; and

(ii) Implead any person that received a distribution
in violation of subsection (c) of this section and seek to
compel contribution from the person in the amount the person
received in violation of subsection (c) of this section.

(e) An action under this section is barred if not
commenced within two (2) years after the distribution.

### **17-29-407. Management of limited liability company.**

limited liability company unless the articles of organization or
the operating agreement:

consent of a majority of the members and remains a manager until
a successor has been chosen, unless the manager at an earlier
time resigns, is removed or dies, or, in the case of a manager
that is not an individual, terminates. A manager may be removed
at any time by the consent of a majority of the members without
notice or cause;

(vi) A person need not be a member to be a manager,
but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes
the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and
a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by
itself dissociate the person as a member;

(vii) A person's ceasing to be a manager does not
discharge any debt, obligation or other liability to the limited
liability company or members which the person incurred while a
manager.

(d) An action requiring the consent of members under this
article may be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint
a proxy or other agent to consent or otherwise act for the
member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the
member's agent.

(e) The dissolution of a limited liability company does
not affect the applicability of this section. However, a person
that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the
right to participate in management as a member and a manager.

(f) This article does not entitle a member to remuneration
for services performed for a member-managed limited liability
company, except for reasonable compensation for services
rendered in winding up the activities of the company.

payment made and indemnify for any debt, obligation or other
liability incurred by a member of a member-managed company or
the manager of a manager-managed company in the course of the
member's or manager's activities on behalf of the company, if,
in making the payment or incurring the debt, obligation or other
liability, the member or manager complied with the duties stated
in W.S. 17-29-405 and 17-29-409.

(b) A limited liability company may purchase and maintain

opinions, reports, statements or other information provided by
another person that the member reasonably believes is a
competent and reliable source for the information.

or a manager-managed limited liability company shall discharge
the duties under this chapter or under the operating agreement
and exercise any rights consistently with the contractual
obligation of good faith and fair dealing.

the information; and

a limited liability company, a dissociated member may have
access to information to which the person was entitled while a
member if the information pertains to the period during which
the person was a member, the person seeks the information in

reasonableness.

### **17-29-502. Transfer of transferable interest.**

(a) A transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable
interest:

(i) Is permissible;

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
does not by itself cause a member's dissociation or a
dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's
activities; and

(iii) Subject to W.S. 17-29-504, does not entitle the
transferee to:

(A) Participate in the management or conduct of
the company's activities; or

(B) Except as otherwise provided in subsection

(c) of this section, have access to records or other information
concerning the company's activities.

(b) A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance
with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would
otherwise be entitled.

(c) In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability
company, a transferee is entitled to an account of the company's
transactions only from the date of dissolution.

(d) A transferable interest may be evidenced by a
certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability
company in a record, and, subject to this section, the interest
represented by the certificate may be transferred by a transfer
of the certificate.

(e) A limited liability company need not give effect to a
transferee's rights under this section until the company has
notice of the transfer.

(f) A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of
a restriction on transfer contained in the operating agreement
is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction
at the time of transfer.

(g) Except as otherwise provided in W.S.
17-29-602(a)(iv)(B), when a member transfers a transferable
interest, the transferor retains the rights of a member other
than the interest in distributions transferred and retains all
duties and obligations of a member.

(h) When a member transfers a transferable interest to a
person that becomes a member with respect to the transferred
interest, the transferee is liable for the member's obligations
under W.S. 17-29-403 and 17-29-406(c) known to the transferee
when the transferee becomes a member.

### **17-29-503. Charging order.**

(a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member or
transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the

liability company to pay over to the person to which the
charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise
be paid to the judgment debtor.

(b) Reserved.

(c) Reserved.

(d) The member or transferee whose transferable interest
is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) of this
section may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the
judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with
the court that issued the charging order.

(e) A limited liability company or one (1) or more members
whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging
order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under
the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment
creditor, including the charging order.

(f) This article does not deprive any member or transferee
of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's
or transferee's transferable interest.

(g) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a
person seeking to enforce a judgment against a judgment debtor,
including any judgment debtor who may be the sole member,
dissociated member or transferee, may, in the capacity of the
judgment creditor, satisfy the judgment from the judgment
debtor's transferable interest or from the assets of the limited
liability company. Other remedies, including foreclosure on the
judgment debtor's limited liability interest and a court order
for directions, accounts and inquiries that the judgment debtor
might have made are not available to the judgment creditor
attempting to satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's
interest in the limited liability company and may not be ordered
by the court.

### **17-29-504. Power of personal representative of deceased member.**

or other legal representative may exercise the rights of a

enforce the right, and the managers or other members do not
bring the action within a reasonable time; or

the name of the company, except for good cause shown, the court
shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit
the committee to make its investigation. This subsection does

restraining order or preliminary injunction.

shall determine whether the members of the committee were
disinterested and independent and whether the committee
conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good
faith, independently and with reasonable care, with the
committee having the burden of proof. If the court finds that
the members of the committee were disinterested and independent
and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and
with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination
of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay
of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this section and
allow the action to proceed under the direction of the
plaintiff.

company organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Liability

organization. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by

deemed to be the articles of organization of the continued

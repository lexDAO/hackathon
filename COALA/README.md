# (Draft) Proposal to expand Codeslaw Legislative hacking

[ToC]

## Why?
1. LexDAO mission - LexDAO is a [guild](https://lexdao.substack.com/p/legal-engineering-certification-via-nft) of legal engineers with mission to innovate and bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code.
2. [Cardano](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14271.pdf) has identified a [community challenge](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26446/about) around crypto-asset ownership, unfair taxation, and privacy.
3. Problem root-cause analysis is 3-fold
- [ ] _Incoherency_ of policy advocation (partly due to PoS)
- [ ] _Inconsistency_ of accounting treatment (different interpretation of same event)
- [ ] _Incomprehensiblity_ of technical jargon (hard to communicate to general public)

## How2

### Sense: 
Cardano community to nominate public submissions opportunities (legislative, regulatory, industry), LexDAO to select a legal engineer to coordinate a formal proposal (eg co-regulation or factual-briefs) within that country. That coordinator will draw in necessary tax, jurisprudence, regulatory, etc expertise as needed whilst polling affected Cardano subDAOs as to priorities/preferences. By fostering internal consensus first, can then draw in industry partners or infuencers based on grounded principles (eg property rights or ESG goals) rather than wish-list.

### Analyse: 
We frame the debate (freedom of association, privity of contract, differential privacy) to triage the public policy mechanisms (protective, preventative, punitive) that identify and triage legislative rules that are detrimental to the success of Cardano ecosystem. Building from repo of comparative law (what works in other countries) we analyse options ranging from factual findings to accounting clarity (definition of tax events) to specific legislative language. 

### Respond: 
Conduct a hackathon of business interests, regulatory observers, and legal engineering professionals to aggregate and condense the analysis into: 
- preferred _policies_, 
- draft _proposals_, or
- specific legal _provisions_. 

These will be compiled into a document for submission after endorsement by the Cardano participants.

## Budget (For3)

We plan to allocate ~$5-10k / hackathon (up to 20-30 public submissions) to
1. participation prizes (books, swag, social capital, etc) for co-regulation drafting ~40%
2. coordinator(s) time to getting submission finalised ~30%
3. bounties to improving the policy repo (comparative law), compiling resources (factual briefs), and language translations (if necessary) ~20%
4. Gas fees for PoAP, snail-mail, communications, meeting-room hire, PR, admin disbursement, etc. <10%
